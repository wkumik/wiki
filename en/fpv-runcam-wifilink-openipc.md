Complete Runcam WiFi Link setup guide 
--------------------------------
So you just bought a Runcam WiFi link? Great!
This guide will help you to set it up. 

The Runcam WiFi link and OpenIPC is still under development, so it’s possible this guide will soon be outdated. 

Issue date: 01 October 2024
What you will need:
INAV 7.1.2
Flight Controller: In this example,  Speedybee f405 WING APP was used.
Runcam WiFiLink + Android Ground station
A working PC/laptop computer with an ethernet port
USB C cable
A fairly modern Smartphone with Android 13 or 14 installed. The smartphone should have a good processor ie. Snapdragon
Internet connection


1. Hardware Setup
Connect the antennas to Runcam.
Connect the 4 cable to UART on Spedybee dedicated to connecting digital VTX’s use the image below as a guide.
 Attention: the cable color codes will match only on one end. Double check your wiring (gnd to gnd, vcc to vcc, etc)
Insert a formatted micro SD card into the Runcam. The slot is on the bottom of the unit, when the fan faces up.
Connect an Ethernet cable  supplied with Runcam to the device.
2. INAV Setup.
Connect your flight controller through a USB C to a computer that has INAV configurator installed
In the Ports tab, set up MSP Display port as per image below. Note: if you are using a different FC then in this example, you might need to chose a different UART.
In the configuration tab, make sure Telemetry and OSD are enabled 

f) Set up OSD in OSD tab. Enable and arrange all the information as you wish. Set  Video Format to AVATAR.


3. Runcam Setup
Insert an empty, formatted micro SD into the runcam device. The card pads need to face the board. The slot for the micro SD can be on the ‘inside’ of the board so you might need to disassemble it to put the card in.
When you first  power up your runcam, the device will create a ‘user’ file and a ‘gs.key’ file. Take the SD card out from your runcam and copy the GS.key file into your android device. You can do it easily using ie. google drive.
4. OpenIPC Configurator setup


OpenIPC cnfigurator is a useful tool to change many different settings on your a camera that runs OpenIPC firmware.

Download and install the latest version of Putty
Download the OpenIPC configurator and install it
Setting up IP
-Connect your runcam to your computer’s Ethernet port with the Ethernet cable provided by Runcam
- Open up a windows file browser, scroll down on the left bar and left click on Network, select properties.
- Select change adapter settings
- double click on Internet Protocol Version 4
- Enter numbers as per image below 

On the configurator, enter IP address: 192.168.1.10 and press connect
Refer to this Readme for setting up OSD
Set up all the settings. There are too many to go through them all here.

5. Android Ground station 
Download Pixel Pilot Apk file from github, straight into your phone.
Go into Android file browser, find that file and install it.
Open the Pixel Pilot app, and tap at the gear icon in top left corner
Set up: Channel: 161
Connect the external wifi adapter with the phone through a USB to USB C adapter. The adapter from runcam can be faulty so if your WFB service doesn't start, try a different adapter. It needs to be OTG (on the go) adapter.
Connect antennas to your external WiFi adapter.
Press the gear icon, then press GS.key, then navigate to the GS.key file you have copied over from the sd card. Select that file.
6. Running the video stream
Turn on the App
Power on your aircraft. The Runcam should start by itself and the fan should be spinning.
After 12-14 seconds you should see on your phone the video from your aircraft.


Mirroring the camera:
The default camera orientation is so that the top of the video is where the cable is.
If you prefer the cable on the bottom, do the following steps:
Take the micro SD card out from your Runcam
Connect the micro SD card to your computer/laptop
Use Notepad to open the file ‘User’. 
Use the following settings: 
Mirror = True
Flip = True
Save the file
Put the micro SD back into the camera


Adding audio
Make sure you have the latest Pixel pilot installed
Install Win SCP to connect to your camera
Connect your camera with ethernet cable and power it on ( use a  3s battery  or a 12V power source
Open WinSCP and connect to your camera 
Go to: etc folder
Open majestic.yaml file with notepad
Scroll down and make sure ‘audio’ section is as below. You can just edit it like a text file.

Save the file and close the winscp
Test if audio in pixel pilot app works.

At the time of writing this Audio works, but it’s not being recorded in the mp4 file.

Troubleshooting:

There is no video on my android device.
Make sure the GS.key file was properly set up. (see point 3 c))

There is still no video
Check if the WiFi card gets hot when Runcam is on. If it’s cold, that means the WiFi broadcast isn’t running.
